# Codex Collaboration Rules

1. All communication, documentation, and code comments must be in English.
2. Every change to the project must update both `README.md` and `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` before it is considered complete.
3. Keep configuration samples (such as `.env.example`) aligned with the settings required to run the application and update them whenever new variables are introduced.
