# Codex Collaboration Rules

1. All communication, documentation, and code comments must be in English.
2. Every change to the project must update both `README.md` and `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` before it is considered complete.
3. Keep configuration samples (such as `.env.example`) aligned with the settings required to run the application and update them whenever new variables are introduced.
4. When altering the database schema, generate an Alembic migration, review it into source control, and document any new workflow steps for contributors.
